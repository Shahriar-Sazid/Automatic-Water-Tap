# Automatic-Water-Tap
This is a sensor controlled water tap, where a sensor detects any obstacle in a certain
range. An ATmega32 microcontroller has been interfaced with IR sensor and stepper
motor. In presence of any obstacle, sensor notifies ATmega32 and it consequently
command the motor to turn on the tap. In absence of obstacle, sensor notifies
ATmega32 and it then command the motor to turn off the tap.
